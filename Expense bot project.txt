Prompt written for moving google sheet to database (not used though)
The project of telegram expense bot is working perfectly fine, but now it is time to take it to the next level
Things we need to start 1st
- we need to make the data logging into the postgres which is hosted on render or some online site like supabase and not in the existing excel sheet 
This is need so that we can perform actions on the data stored in the database and not in the sheets 
Help with this move from storing the data into sheet to a postgres database on render or on supbase whichever is easy to use, free and easily scalable to use 



Prompt used 
The project of telegram expense bot is working perfectly fine, but now it is time to take it to the next level

Things we need to do
1. instead of storing data into the google sheet we now need to store the data into the database postgres on render or by using supabase
2. we need to make a signup or a page where user can come and register to use this app, this is to seperate the user data 
3. the user seperation is need because we need to make a cron/scheduler which send the daily expense summary at 11pm to the user on their telegram, we also need to send monthly expense on the last day of month with money spend and catergory
4. we need to make command that user can use on telegram so see the daily/monthly summary instantly 

so we can go one by one and make this project a Saas model which we can use to make out of it , let's start 




23rd August 
The entire project is working live on render 
Things done 
-added db storage and user segregation using users table and expenses table 
-user can only see the expense of them and not of others
-/start to register on telegram bot 
- 200 coffee, 100 cab can be sent in message to store the address
-/daily command sent to bot to see the details of expenses done that day
-/monthly command sent to bot to see the details of all expenses in that month

Things to do 
-avoid duplicate user registration on /start
-add more categories and section(see llm usage here)
-add cron jobs to send daily expense at 11:59pm and monthly cron to send at last day of month at 11:59 (After that day's daily expense cron)
